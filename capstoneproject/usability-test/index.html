  <h1>Usability Testing Results</h1>

  <img src="test.png" width="100%" alt="Usability Test Results" />

  <h2>Observations from Testing</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Confusing Navigation:</strong> Several users weren’t sure if clicking on a name in the sidebar would open more details. Once they discovered it, they found the feature useful.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Popups Are Effective:</strong> Users responded positively to the popups containing detailed information. They appreciated the visuals and the contextual layout of each profile.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Search Needs Refinement:</strong> Some users expected the search bar to give more intelligent results, like autocomplete or related suggestions.</p>

  <h2>What Needs Improvement</h2>
  <p>The project could benefit from a more intuitive sidebar layout. It’s not obvious that items are clickable, and the risk level color indicators could be more consistent. Also, some of the mugshots were repetitive, which made the experience feel less dynamic.</p>

  <h2>User Interaction and Impact</h2>
  <p>Most users figured out how to use the basic functions after a short period. However, the initial learning curve could be smoothed out. The project did leave an impression—users described it as "interesting" and "slightly dystopian," which aligns with the intended impact.</p>

  <h2>Modifications for Better UX</h2>
  <p>We plan to improve the visual feedback on tabs and sidebar items, diversify the mugshot images more effectively, and add search enhancements. Adding a short onboarding tooltip could help first-time users too.</p>

  <h2>Update Plan</h2>
  <p>Based on feedback, the next steps include: 1) improving sidebar card styles and interactivity, 2) generating a better variety of mugshots using different image sources, and 3) refining search logic to feel smarter. These changes aim to make the experience smoother and more engaging.</p>
