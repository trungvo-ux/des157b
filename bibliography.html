        <div class="citation">Ratti, Carlo, and Matthew Claudel. <i>The City of Tomorrow: Sensors, Networks, Hackers, and the Future of Urban Life</i>. Yale University Press, 2016.</div>
        <div class="annotation">
            This book explores how data, technology, and networks are transforming urban life. It's highly relevant to the capstone project’s goal of visualizing geospatial and social data. Ratti, a professor at MIT and director of the Senseable City Lab, offers credible insights into urban sensing and citizen-based data systems. The authors argue for the power of open-source infrastructure and participatory design in building smarter cities. This helped inspire the use of real-time location and syntheti...

        <div class="citation">Pasquale, Frank. <i>The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information</i>. Harvard University Press, 2015.</div>
        <div class="annotation">
            Pasquale examines the role of opaque algorithms in shaping societal structures, particularly in finance, law, and surveillance. This book is crucial to understanding the dangers of unaccountable data systems, directly aligning with the capstone’s themes of control and visibility. His background in law and technology strengthens the credibility of his critique. Pasquale's concept of "black box profiling" supports the speculative use of social ratings in the project. My key takeaway is the impo...

        <div class="annotation">
            This website uses GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to create synthetic human faces. It's not a scholarly source but serves as a visual and ethical cornerstone for the capstone project’s design. By using AI-generated mugshots, the project removes identifiable real-world data while still triggering an emotional reaction from users. Its realism adds narrative power to the speculative concept. The site illustrates how technology can blur fiction and reality, raising questions about surveill...
